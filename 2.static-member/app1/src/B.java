/*
The code you provided defines a class named `B` with multiple static variables (`i`, `j`, and `k`) of different types. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The class `B` contains three static variables: `i` (of type `int`), `j` (of type `double`), and `k` (of type `boolean`). Static variables belong to the class itself and are shared among all objects of the class.

2. Inside the `main` method, there are three lines of code that print the values of the static variables to the console using `System.out.println()`.

3. The `System.out` and `println` parts work the same way as in the previous examples.

4. Since the static variables are not explicitly assigned values, they will have default values based on their types:
   - `i` (int): default value is `0`
   - `j` (double): default value is `0.0`
   - `k` (boolean): default value is `false`

5. When you run this Java program, it will output the following:

```
0
0.0
false
```

In summary, this code demonstrates the usage of multiple static variables of different types in class `B`. The `main` method prints the default values of these variables, as they are not explicitly assigned any values.
