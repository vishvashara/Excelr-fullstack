/*
Decimal values are a way of representing numbers using a base-10 system. This means that each digit in a decimal number represents a power of ten, with the rightmost digit representing the ones place, the next digit to the left representing the tens place, and so on.

For example, the decimal number 123 can be represented as follows:

123 = 1 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 3 * 1

Standard ASCII codes range from 0 to 127 in Decimal or 00 to 7F in Hexadecimal, they are mainly used for representing characters.
